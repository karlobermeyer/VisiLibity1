  title = {Visibility Algorithms in the Plane},
  abstract = {{A human observer can effortlessly identify visible portions of
    geometric objects present in the environment. However, computations of
    visible portions of objects from a viewpoint involving thousands of objects
    is a time consuming task even for high speed computers. To solve such
    visibility problems, efficient algorithms have been designed. This book
    presents some of these visibility algorithms in two dimensions.
    Specifically, basic algorithms for point visibility, weak visibility,
    shortest paths, visibility graphs, link paths and visibility queries are all
    discussed. Several geometric properties are also established through lemmas
    and theorems. With over 300 figures and hundreds of exercises, this book is
    ideal for graduate students and researchers in the field of computational
    geometry.  It will also be useful as a reference for researchers working in
    algorithms, robotics, computer graphics and geometric graph theory, and some
    algorithms from the book can be used in a first course in computational
    geometry.}},

  abstract = {This well-accepted introduction to computational geometry is a
    textbook for high-level undergraduate and low-level graduate courses. The
    focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in
    computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the
    application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry
    are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and
    geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be
    especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to
    provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and
    implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry,
    as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely
    self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic
    background in algorithms. In the second edition, besides revisions to the
    first edition, a number of new exercises have been added.},

    introduction to the design and implementation of geometry algorithms arising
    in areas such as computer graphics, robotics, and engineering design. The
    second edition contains material on several new topics, such as randomized
    algorithms for polygon triangulation, planar point location, 3D convex hull
    construction, intersection algorithms for ray-segment and ray-triangle, and
    point-in-polyhedron. A new "Sources" chapter points to supplemental
    literature for readers needing more information on any topic. A novel aspect
    is the inclusion of working C code for many of the algorithms, with
    discussion of practical implementation issues. The self-contained treatment
    presumes only an elementary knowledge of mathematics, but reaches topics on
    the frontier of current research, making it a useful reference for
    practitioners at all levels. The code in this new edition is significantly
    improved from the first edition, and four new routines are included. Java
    versions for this new edition are also available. All code is accessible
    from the book's Web site (http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/) or by anonymous
    ftp.},
