    <h2 class="article-title">About</h2>
    <p>
      VisiLibity is a free open source C++ library for 2D floating-point
      visibility algorithms, path planning, and supporting data types. It is
      intended for use in robot and sensor network design software. Other
      possible applications include, e.g., manufacturing, facility location,
      architectural/urban planning, games, and education. The entire library
      consists only of a single compilation unit (one <code>.hpp</code> + one
      <code>.cpp</code> file) with no dependence on 3rd party libraries. It is
      therefore suitable for applications where simple visibility and path
      planning computations are needed but the power of a larger computational
      geometry library is not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Current Functionality of VisiLibity v1</b> in planar polygonal
      environments with polygonal holes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>visibility polygons</li>
      <li>visibility graphs</li>
      <li>Euclidean shortest paths for a point</li>
      <li>Python, Ruby, and Matlab bindings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Exact/arbitrary precision arithmetic is avoided and robustness is
      achieved by considering 2 points to be colocated whenever the Euclidean
      distance between them is less or equal to a user-defined tolerance
      &epsilon; called the <em>robustness constant</em>.  If the robustness
      constant is chosen poorly or the scale of environment features varies too
      dramatically, library functions can and will return errors.  However,
      provided the user tunes the robustness constant appropriately, we find
      the library works well for a large range of useful environments.

    <h2 class="article-title">Math</h2>
    <p>
      VisiLibity uses the C++ double type.  In this floating-point system, a
      discrete string of bits represents a number from the continuum of real
      numbers.  One indicator of how precisely a floating point system can
      represent a real number is the <em>machine epsilon</em> (aka <em>machine
      precision</em> or <em>unit roundoff</em>) defined as the difference
      between 1 and the smallest exactly representable number greater than one.
      In the IEEE 754 Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, machine
      epsilon for <em>double precision</em> on a 32-bit machine is
      2<sup>-52</sup> (roughly 2.22x10<sup>-16</sup>). Despite this small value,
      it is well known that the inexact nature of floating-point representation
      can lead to many problems, e.g.,
    </p>
  	<ul>
  	   <li>overflow, underflow, round-off error</li>
  	   <li>divide by zero</li>
  	   <li>complex values</li>
  	   <li>loss of significance when subtracting nearly equal numbers</li>
  	   <li>addition and multiplication are both commutative, but not necessarily associative</li>
  	   <li>computational sequences that are analytically equal may produce different values</li>
  	   <li>small errors can grow very large during an iterative process</li>
  	   <li>evaluation of transcentental functions is approximate.</li>
  	</ul>
    <p>
    	More details on problems associated with floating-point
    	arithmetic can be found, e.g., in <a
    	href="http://dlc.sun.com/pdf/800-7895/800-7895.pdf" target="_blank">"What
    	Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating Point
    	Arithmetic"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	So why use floating-point arithmetic?
    	As <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/yap/" target="_blank">Chee
    	K. Yap</a> wrote in the "Handbook of Discrete and Computational
    	Geometry" (2nd Edition, p. 930),
    </p>
  	<blockquote>
      <em>
        "...fast floating-point hardware has become a de facto standard in
        every computer. If we can make our geometric algorithms robust within
        machine arithmetic, we are assured of the fastest possible
        implementation..."
    	</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    	To achieve robustness using floating-point arithmetic, VisiLibity
    	operates using a technique called &epsilon;-geometry (AKA interval
    	geometry) in which geometric primitives are fattened by very small
    	amount &epsilon;.  This involves the use of <em>fuzzy comparisons</em> in
    	which equality tests such as x==y are replaced by fabs(x-y) &#8804;
    	&epsilon;.  When using VisiLibity, &epsilon; should typically be chosen
    	somewhere between machine epsilon and the smallest dimension of any
    	feature in the environment geometry at hand.
    	<!--We are currenly working on more rigorous ways to choose &epsilon;
    	values (as a function of input geometry) that guarantee performance.
    	Results will be posted here as available.-->
    </p>

    <p>
    	The algorithms and methods used in VisiLibity come mostly from these
    	sources: <a href="./VisiLibity.bib"
    	target="_blank"><code>VisiLibity.bib</code></a>
    	(BibTeX file)

    	<!--
      interval geometry (fattening of primitives) + rounded geometry
      (parameters of defining equations take on values in intervals)

      The creation of thoroughly robust floating-point software is a delecate
      undertaking requiring a good understanding of numerical analysis.
